		  angles need to be re-examined...
		* Fixed the major math issues

Friday, January 30, 2009
	Chris Thielen:
		* Reverted back font changes as Jared has sent me afont-0.7 which should have OpenGL fixes we need (afont is faster than NeHe's freetype/OpenGL code as fonts are pre-rendered and saved)

		* Fixed a bug/typo in configure.in, thanks Leon Vayman for the report/fix

Sunday October 12, 2008
	Chris Thielen:
		* Fixed an issue with the way we ensure powers of two: added tw,th (texture scaling coords) to Image
		  to account for this issue (when we expand the texture canvas, we need to set the scaling coords so
		  it looks as though we didn't do this)
		* Fixed a bug with Coordinate where it would enforce boundaries that hadn't been set
		* Continued UI work, getting mouse focus features down so clicking buttons work, then continue on
		  with additional widgets

	Matthew Zweig:
		* Changed scaling and coloring in the Hud Radar.  Ships are Red, Planets are Blue, else grey.

	Chris Thielen:
		* Implemented Image::ExpandCanvas(), which is called automatically for OpenGL surfaces that do not have

		* Implemented Image::DrawAbsoluteTiled, using a lot in GUI skinning. There's some oddities still when it tiles something
		  with a 1 pixel dimension
		* Updated UI::Window to the new GUI theme

	Chris Thielen:
		* Added Utilities/xml.h, Utilities/xml.cpp
