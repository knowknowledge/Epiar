Basic Installation
==================

Compiling
=========

In order to compile the game you need the next dependancies (some of
them will be used in the future but not in the present):
sdl, sdl_image, sdl_net, sdl_mixer, openal, mesa, libgl, libxml2, zlib
On some linux distributions those dependancies needed to compile and
dependancies needed to run a game are separated to two packages make sure
you install them both (for example sdl and sdl-dev etc..)

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. 'cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     'sh autogen.sh' to generate a configure file for the package.

  2. Type './configure' this will check and see if the dependancies are
     installed on the system, if it fails saying that something was not 
     found make sure you installed the dependancies we listed above.

  3. Type 'make' to compile the package.

  !Right now there is no auto install method please check the next section!

Installing
==========

In the time of writing this document there is not installation method
Epiar creates a bin file in the same foder that all the game and compilation
data resides (the cvs folder you checked into), In the feaute data folder
would be separted and also 'make install' will work, util then if you want
to package this app or want to have a cleat directory with only the files
needed for Epiar to work do the next things:

  1.  Decide where you want the data dir of epiar to be and make sure you have 
      permissions to write to this new dir (by applying sudo to the next 
      operations if needed)
      
  2.  Create this folder with 'mkdir -p /the/epiar/dir'
  
  3.  copy all files with the extensions *.xml *.png *.af *.dat *.ani
      from the folder you built epiar in to thenew dir. 
      you can do this with 'cp -t /the/epiar/dir *.xml *.png *.af *.dat *.ani'.
      
  3.  Copy the Epiar executable to the same dir 'cp Epiar /the/epiar/dir'
  
  4.  You can remove the dir you compiled in with 'rm -r /compiling/dir' 
  
  5.  For conviniance you can create a simple shell script to put in "/usr/bin"
      Follow the instructions in the next section if you want to do so.
  
The Script
==========

To have epiar executed whenever you write 'epiar' in the terminal, you create the
next script and move it to "/usr/bin"

The script file name should be "epiar" or any other name that you wish to type in
the terminal to run epiar.

Inside this text file put the lines beetwen -start- and -end-:
-start-
#!/bin/sh

cd /the/epiar/dir/
./Epiar
-end-

Note that "/the/epiar/dir/" should be changed to the directory with epiar data in it.

Next make sure the script is executable by running 'chmod a+x epiar", change epiar to
the name of your script if needed.

Finally copy this script to "/usr/bin" (you will probably need to use sudo with the 
next command) 'mv epiar /usr/bin' or with sudo 'sudo mv epiar /usr/bin'

Enjoy!
