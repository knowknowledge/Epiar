afont version 0.8
by Jared Minch

afont is a simple library to generate bitmapped fonts from TrueType fonts,
and then display text using SDL or OpenGL, without depending on the freetype
or SDL_ttf libraries in your SDL program.

Building the ".af" font files is done using the buildfont program.  The
usage is:
  buildfont [font.ttf] [size] [bpp]
where font.ttf is the TrueType font you want to convert, and size is the
pixel size that the font should be bitmapped at.  If bpp is 1, then a 1-bit
mono font is created; if bpp is 8, then a 8-bit antialiased font is created.
(Note that 1-bit fonts only work with GL rendering at the moment.)
Normally, the generated font is dumped to standard output; under windows, it
is saved to the file "out.af".

There is a comment explaining the format of the .af files in buildfont.c.
If the file format changes, the version number in the header will be updated
to reflect the change.

To use the fonts, link afont_base.c in with the rest of your program, as
well as afont_sdl.c or afont_gl.c, depending on whether you want the SDL or
openGL rendering functionality.  See the comments in the appropriate header
files for information about usage.

If your system does not have the ntohl and htonl functions, then define
SYS_IS_BRAINDEAD in order to use builtin versions.

Sample programs, testafont and testglfont, are included.
